# Password_Manager
## Application for storing passwords
## Program written as a part of PJC course at PJATK
The program is used for storing users' passwords. All files with information about passwords are encrypted using XOR encryption. 
Passwords are divided into different categories; each website has its website, login, and password.
File reading was implemented using the nlohhman JSON library. 
Information about the last login is stored in timestamp.txt file. Information is divided into different lines for security.
